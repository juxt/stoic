# stoic

This library marries Stuart Sierras Component library with distributed config. Feed Stoic a SystemMap and it will ensure that the relevant components are bounced when their config changes. Config-suppliers are pluggable, at present Zookeeper is the sole config supplier implementation.

Coming soon, a blog to explain and a better readme!
